Transit accessibility, Service area maps: To service locations, scheduled-based departure:

The TO service area for the scheduled-based arrival contains all buildings from which a traveler, who knows the transit timetable can reach one of the facility buildings with public transport. The traveler starts the trip to avoid waiting at the first transit stop. 

The trip duration cannot be longer than the given maximum travel time. 

Two possible traveler choices are analyzed and two outputs are constructed â€“ for the travelers who choose the fastest trip and for the travelers who choose the latest arrival possible.

Compare accessibility maps, Service area

The comparison is performed for the outcomes of two scenarios if:

•	Compared maps are both maps of the service areas.
•	The overlap between the two maps is not empty.

If both tests are successfully passed, the comparison is made for the spatially overlapping parts of the output.

The non-overlapping parts are presented as two additional layers.

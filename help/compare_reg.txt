Compare accessibility maps, Regions

The comparison is performed for the outcomes of two scenarios if:

•	Compared maps are both maps of the region accessibility.
•	The overlap between the two maps is not empty.
•	Time bins of both outputs are the same.

If all three tests are successfully passed, the comparison is made for the spatially overlapping parts of the output. 

The non-overlapping parts are presented as additional layers.

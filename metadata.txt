  # General
  - UI and dialogs are improved and clarified
  - The transit routing database construction is combined with the transit accessibility calculations block, while the car routing database construction is combined with the car accessibility calculations. The database construction section of the menu is cancelled.
  - The explanation of the menu option is added to the option dialog’s right panel
  - The software is tested with several GTFS datasets representing cities in different countries and continents
  - The performance of many procedures is essentially improved
  # Database construction
  - The test of the availability and completeness of the road layer attributes before constructing the database is added
  # Schedule-based accessibility
  - Two different outputs are built, the first reflecting the earliest/latest arrival (the earliest for the FROM-accessibility and latest in the case of the TO-accessibility), and the second the latest arrival
